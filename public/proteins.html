    With the issue of sustainable development, a lot of people have reduced their meat consumption. Meat is the main source of proteins and you'll need protein for a good growth. So if you plan on replacing meat in your daily diet, check those alternatives.
</p>

<h4>
    Animal-based
</h4>

<p>
    There are lots of other options when looking for animal-based proteins. One of them is fish. Eating two portion of fish each week is a good plus to your diet. Make sure to incorporate both oily and white fishes to enjoy both of their benefits.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, you can add eggs in the balance. You can make lot of dishes with them and they are also sources of vitamin D and B12. You may need to check with your dietetician if you are sensible to cholesterol but usually, eggs does not represent an issue.
</p>

<p>
    You may also consider dairy sources. In addition to calcium, they carry a decent amount of proteins. Milk is probably the most popular option but one can also try plain yoghurt. Be careful however if you try cheese as it may contain fat.
</p>

<h4>
    Plant-based
</h4>

<p>
    For those who follow a vegetarian diet, there is proteins even in some plants. Most notably, pulses like beans, peas, or lentils are rich in proteins and they still count in your 5-a-day. Plus, they are easy to add in your recipies.
</p>

<p>
    Another source to consider is complete proteins. They are plant-based proteins similar to animal-based ones. The best option is soya, who have been used in several products. But you can also try quinoa to change from rice and pasta or Quorn<sup>TM</sup> to replace minced meat.
</p>

<p>Finally, nuts, seeds, and grains are also a good source of proteins. Nuts may be consumed during snacks but do not eat to much as they contain unsaturated fats. You can also eat seeds during snacks, but why not getting creative and add them to a salad. To conclude, wholegrain bread or rice are also a good substitute to meat.</p>

<p>
    Do not completely throw meat away however. You should keep it in your diet but try and get a meat-free every week. This will be better for your health and for the planet.
